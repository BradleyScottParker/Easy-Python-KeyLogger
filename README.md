# Easy-Python-KeyLogger
KeyLogger that sends keystrokes to your email

This keylogger was very easy to create.   Although I did not write the original code, I did tweak it to work for me.  The modules used in it are getpass and stmplib; the links to their documentation are below. 

Smtplib documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html

Getpass documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/getpass.html
